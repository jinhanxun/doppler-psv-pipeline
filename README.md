# Automated Pipeline for Doppler PSV Quantification
**Minimal‚Äëinput, bias‚Äëreduced spectral envelope tracking for Doppler ultrasound.**

This repository contains a lightweight Python pipeline to quantify **peak systolic velocity (PSV)** from spectral Doppler images.  
It standardizes image scale, isolates the trace via user‚Äëguided cropping, converts to grayscale, performs **vertical intensity averaging**, and detects cycle‚Äëwise PSV using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`.  
Outputs include **annotated images** with detected PSV points and **CSV tables** with pixel coordinates, calibrated velocities, and per‚Äëcycle summary statistics.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Minimal user input (scale markers + cropping); no manual PSV picking
- Vertical intensity averaging for robust spectral envelope extraction
- Adaptive peak detection per cardiac cycle via `find_peaks`
- Batch processing of folders of images
- Reproducible **CSV outputs** and **annotated PNGs/JPGs**
- Tunable detection parameters (band width, prominence, distance, etc.)

> Feel free to rename the script to `psv_pipeline.py` later; keeping your original filename for now.

---

## üöÄ Quick start
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Organize images**  
   Put input images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) into a folder, e.g., `data/input/`.

3. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python pig_dataprocess_auto.py
   ```
   By default the script reads images from a configured input folder and writes **annotated images** and **CSV files** to an output folder.  
   (If your current version uses constants at the top of the file‚Äîe.g., `INPUT_FOLDER`, `OUTPUT_FOLDER`, `TARGET_WIDTH`, `BAND_WIDTH`, `DIST_MIN`, `PROMINENCE_FACTOR`, `HEIGHT_FACTOR`, `BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD`, etc.‚Äîadjust them there.)

> **Tip:** If you'd like a CLI with flags (e.g., `--input`, `--output`), I can refactor the script into a module and add an argparse interface.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration knobs
Common parameters (found near the top of the script):
- `TARGET_WIDTH` ‚Äì standardize all images to this width before processing
- `BAND_WIDTH` ‚Äì number of vertical pixels for local intensity band averaging
- `DIST_MIN` ‚Äì minimum horizontal distance (pixels) between detected PSV peaks
- `PROMINENCE_FACTOR`, `HEIGHT_FACTOR` ‚Äì adaptive thresholds for `find_peaks`
- `BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD` ‚Äì ignore very dark pixels/noise in the spectral region
- (plus any of your `INPUT_FOLDER`, `OUTPUT_FOLDER`, cropping and scale settings)

---

## üì¶ Outputs
For each input image, the pipeline produces:
- **`<name>_labeled.<ext>`** ‚Äì image annotated with PSV detections/markers
- **`<name>_psv.csv`** ‚Äì per‚Äëcycle table of:
  - `X Position (pixels)`
  - `Y Position (pixels)`
  - `Converted Y Position (velocity units)` *(after calibration)*
- **`<name>_psv_summary.csv`** (if applicable) ‚Äì means/SD across cycles

The script prints a progress log in the terminal and summarizes what was saved.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation
The method has been validated on multiple independent batches of ultrasound images to confirm **consistency** and **robustness**. For manuscript use, add a short ‚ÄúValidation‚Äù subsection describing datasets, inter/intra‚Äëbatch results, and any inter‚Äëoperator checks if applicable.

---

## üß™ Reproducibility notes
- Fix `TARGET_WIDTH` and all thresholds/scale markers for a given dataset.
- Keep a small `examples/images/` set to sanity‚Äëcheck future changes.
- Use `DEBUG = True` in the script to visualize intermediate steps (if provided).
